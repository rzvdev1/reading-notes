# Hello

This topic matters beacuase understanding and working with forms in react is slightly different which has different functionality. To understand why this work will help in the long run when working with client side server.

A controlled component is he form data is handled by the state within the component. We update the state with their responses as soon as they enter them because the inputâ€™s value is always driven by the React state. We target what the user is entering by the onChange event.

We will use the ternary operator for shorthand of a if/else statement.

Rewrite the following statement using a ternary:

         x === y ? true : false

## Things I want to know more about

1. How is the onChange pass throught the setState?

2. How would you target a specific element in a array of objects using the ternary operator?
