# Hello

This topic matters because understanding the Concepts of Functional Programming in Javascript will help you better write codes of line with minimum and errors. No need to be robust and maintenance is very easy. Working on a team will be a lot easier and less debugging.

Functional programming is a programming paradigm — a style of building the structure and elements of computer programs — that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids changing-state and mutable data. Pure function returns a same results if given same arguments and no side effects. The benefits of pure function is easier to test and a given parameter A will expect function to return value B. Immutability is Unchanging over time or unable to be changed. Referential transparency is the combination of pure functions + immutable data meaning a function consistently yields the same result for the same input.

A module is a JavaScript file with logical code with functionality and can be reused whenever. The word require make you use the file from else where anywhere in the application. To bring another module into the file the we are working in you will need to use module.export = function name. To make a module available you will need to it a variable.

## Things I want to know more about

1. Are build in methods in JavaScript consider Functional Programming?
2. ES modules and CommonJS modules in Node.js
