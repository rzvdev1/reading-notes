# OSS Contributions

## First Timers Only

- I learn best by doing, so I’m going to start by finding a project that I’m interested in and making a contribution. I’m going to start with a project that has a “first-timers-only” label. This label is used to indicate that the owners of the project are willing to help you make your first contribution. It’s a great way to get started.

## GitHub’s Guide to Open Source

- The GitHub Guide to Open Source is a great place to start. It’s a collection of resources that will help you learn more about open source and how to get involved. I look forward to seeing what I can find there. I will take advantage of the resources available to me and learn as much as I can.

## What Motivates a Developer to Contribute to Open-Source Software?

- From the article I choose the second Gain Early Experience. I think this is a great way to gain experience and learn from others. I can use this and add to my portfolio to show future employers. I like the Improve Software on a User and Business Level. I can learn from the business side and see how they operate and how they make decisions. I can learn from the user side and see what they like and dislike about the software. I can use this to improve my own software and make it better for the user when I have my own start up.
