# Hello

This topic is important because this is the core to web development and I studying to become a proficient developer. I will be studying web development in this module and learing the nessasary key items.

I learn that an HTML attribute is inforamtion that wont appear on the content and used as a target to style the element. You can add a image to a browser with the img tag which will need a source of the image. The main difference between the article is a global attributes and section is a event attributes.The metadata tag is what the html cannot repersent like the script tag. The first step to design a website is why and how to target the audience.

JavaScript requires a script tag to be added to the HTML file. JavaScript requires interactive behavior to web pages and script file. You can create a string and number with var, let or const. The difference is one will be inside a double quotes or single quotes and the other will not have a quote. Here is an example:

        <script>
          let greet = "Hello World!";
          let age = 25;
          </script>

## Things I want to know more about

1. Is there a HTML libary?

2. When creating a website how is it patched from a cyber attack?
