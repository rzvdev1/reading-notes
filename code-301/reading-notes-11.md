# Hello

This topic matters because understanding everything is dynamic code and need to know how to work with database. Understand how to make create and update database is a key factor to a developer.

| SQL                                | NoSQL                                  |

| Relational Databases               | non-relational or distributed database |
| Table based databases              | Graph databases                        |
| Predefined schema                  | Dynamic schema                         |
| Vertically scalable                | Horizontally scalable                  |
| Defining and manipulating the data | Collection of documents                |

The SQL database is a good fit for the complex query intensive environment. A real world example is the platform Netflix.

The NoSQL database is a good fit for non complex queries. A real world wxample is E-commerce applications.

The best for hierarchical data storage is NoSQL. The database is best for scalability SQL.

SQL stands for Structured query language. A relational database is a type of database that stores and provides access to data points that are related to one another. The structure a relational database work with is organizing related data points.

A schema is . A non-relational database is a database that does not use the tabular schema of rows and columns found in most traditional database systems. A non-relational databases use a storage model that is optimized for the specific requirements of the type of data being stored. A schema is defines how data is organized within a relational database. Inside of a MongoDB there is one or more collections of document. The MongoDB is more flexible because don't have such constraints. Disadvantage of NoSQL databases is that they donâ€™t support ACID (atomicity, consistency, isolation, durability) transactions across multiple documents.

Which is more flexible - SQL or MongoDB? and why.

## Things I want to know more about

1. Are there restrictions to using database on certain Operating System?
2. For a database are the backend languages flexiable to work with?
