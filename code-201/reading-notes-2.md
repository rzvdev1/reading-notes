# Hello

This topic is important because this is the core to web development and fully understanding the basic fundamental will help in the long run.

Semantic elements are very important due to giving the correct meaning as a global content. There are 6 levels headings in HTML. The use of <sub> and <sup> are for dates, chemical formulae, and mathematical equations. The difference one is upper level and lower level. Example of this is

            <p>My birthday is on the 25<sup>th</sup> of May 2001.</p>

            <p>
            Caffeine's chemical formula is
            C<sub>8</sub>H<sub>10</sub>N<sub>4</sub>O<sub>2</sub>.
            </p>
            <p>If x<sup>2</sup> is 9, x must equal 3 or -3.</p>

## Things I want to know more about

1. Is there a HTML libary?

2. When creating a website how is it patched from a cyber attack?
