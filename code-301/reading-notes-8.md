# Hello

This topic matters because as a devloper you will need to work with backend servers that require API usages. You have to be proficient at it and everything is stored in a database now and days.

The REST stands for Representational State Transfer. The REST APIs are designed around resources, which are any kind of object, data, or service that can be accessed by the client. An identifier of a resource is a URI that uniquely identifies that resource, for example https://adventure-works.com/orders/1. The common HTTP verbs are POST, GET, PUT, DELETE. The URl based on collections and items into a hierarchy. An example of URI is/customers/{id}. To have a ‘chatty’ web API means web requests. Is this a good thing because your site it popular like amazon. An unsuccessful GET request return 404 (Not Found). A successful POST request return HTTP status code 201 (Created). A successful DELETE request return status code 204 (No Content), indicating that the process has been successfully handled.
