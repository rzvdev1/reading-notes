## Growth Mindset

when ever you encounter a issue you cant solve right away step back and clear your head goal is not to quit. Come back and try again.
Putting in more effort comes a long way and you will see the difference in the long run. Those safrices now will impact your future self.
I believe growth mindset is also taking criticism it will make you or break you at first. Like the article said this is the dakr side of growth and it it something necessary for us to develop to better our self.
Whenever I dont feel like motivation for anything I go on youtube and watch some motivational video keep me going.
Whenever I encounter a problem I cannot solve I walk away and find my self do something not realted to the task to clear my mind.
Taking feedback from other will help me from others to learn and grow to become a better mind set.

My favorite quote is

> “Pain unlocks a secret doorway in the mind, one that leads to both peak performance, and beautiful silence.” - David Goggins
