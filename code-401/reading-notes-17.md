# AWS: S3 and Lambda

## AWS S3

What is Amazon S3?
Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) is an object storage service offering industry-leading scalability, data availability, security, and performance. Amazon S3 is used for a wide range of use cases, such as storing web assets, hosting static websites, backing up and restoring data, and storing data for archival and disaster recovery. The benefits of using Amazon S3 are that it is highly scalable, reliable, fast, inexpensive, and secure. No matter the size of your business, Amazon S3 provides highly scalable object storage that you can use to store and retrieve any amount of data from anywhere.

## AWS Lambda Basics

AWS Lambda create functions, self-contained applications written in one of the supported languages and runtimes, and upload them to AWS Lambda, which executes those functions in an efficient and flexible manner. The cases to use AWS Lambda are individual tasks run for a short time, each task is generally self-contained, and there is a large difference between the lowest and highest levels in the workload of the application. Serverless is a cloud servers that are managed by a third-party provider. The provider handles the server management and capacity planning. The user only pays for the amount of resources that they use. No need to worry about server maintenance, security, or scaling. For example a serverless application is like a vending machine. The user puts in money and the machine gives them what they want. The user does not need to worry about how the machine works or how it is maintained.

## CDN

A Content Delivery Network (CDN) is a geographically distributed group of servers that work together to provide fast delivery of Internet content. A CDN allows for the fast transfer of data needed for loading Internet content including HTML pages, javascript files, stylesheets, images, and videos. The CDN works in a relation to the website visitor by storing cache versions of the website on servers around the world. When a user visits a website, the CDN redirects them to the closest server to their location. This reduces the amount of time it takes for the website to load. The CDN also reduces the load on the website's server, which helps prevent the website from crashing. The benefits of using a CDN are that it improves website load times, reduces bandwidth costs, increases content availability, and improves website security.

## Reflection

My goals after reading and reviewing the class README are understanding the following:

- Creating S3 Buckets for file storage
- Creating Lambda functions for serverless applications
- Serverless functions
- Passing data between Lambda functions
