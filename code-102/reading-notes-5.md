# Hello

CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets is will make your website more presentable and it is a rule based rule. The syntax uses a starts with a selector opens with curly braces with the curly braces you can add a property with a value. For example, with the property and value you can change the H1 tag and make the property font-size and value 25px to display on the web page. Every HTML tag can be stye with CSS and just like the index.html it has file.

There are 3 ways to link a CSS file External CSS, Internal CSS, and Inline CSS. The external file for CSS with be style.css it is a sepertare and you can link with the link tag. The Internal CSS starts with the style tag and CSS will go inside the HTML file no need to link. The inline CSS style for a single element and only applies for that element. I also learn you can group the selector so you dont reapeat yourself and make it less messy.

## Things I want to know more about

1. Can you link an external CSS style remotely from someone else local machine or does it have to be a live web page?

2. I want to learn more about Major object types for CSS.
