# Hello

I have learn that before git there was Local Version Control systems. Over the years the control system got better and help developers to share file. This is a good way but only issue was each had a problem for example if the Distributed Version Control systems was down you can not do anything not even save the changes or edit files. I learn the git is a snapshot of a file and stores it. It stacks a bunch of snapshots together and displays the whole overview without making a messy file.

Git came from the linux community becasue there was tension with BitKeeper. The best thing about git and linux they are a open source no need to pay. The linux community change the way files are stored and shared. I also learn that is a non-linear development you can pass a huge files or projects without any corruption. Git also runs in 3 stages which are Committed, Modified, and Staged. It is a very simple system to use for its design.

## Things I want to know more about
1. In 2005, if there was no tension would linux became a paid source like BitKeeper?

2. Does BitKeeper regret losing the linux community because they have millions of developes using their sysytem?
