# Hello

## What I have learn

I have learn that a text editor a software for files to build a website from stratch and free software to use. Each text editor does the same function write code from files and deploy them to build a website. I also learn the IDE (Integrated Development Environment) is similar to text editor but it is not the same. You can do everything from text edit, to debug code, and it is a complier. I learn that there are 2 third party text editor that I did not know was the TextWrangler and BB Edit. 

The command line is a interface that a user interacts with the computer. Everything can be can in the terminal and well know command line will the linux. I learn the difference between Absolute and Relative Paths which one is relation to the root of the file system. Learning how to naviagte the command line with ls and cd to get to where I want to go. The linux command line is very sensitive you cannot have a missing letter, extra letter, a space missing or no space at all. One cool feature is the command ls -a to show hidden files.



## Things I want to know more about

1. what is -rwxr-xr-x in the linux? 

2. Is the folder/finder in windows, linux, and macOS consider the command line to the user?
