# Hello

This topic matters beacuase understanding the fundementals of react will help you prep for the further development in react and how to handel them properly.

The first thing that happens based off the diagram is the render. The very first that happens in the lifecycle of react is the mounting. The order things happen in react is constructor, render, componentDidMount, React updates, componentWillUnmount. The componentDidMount is a method that is invoked immediately after a component is mounted

The things you can pass in the props are arguments that you want to render. The difference between props and state is that props you pass into a compenent and is handle outside the compenent and state is handle inside the compenent. We re-render our application from the state. Examples of what can be stored in state is having a counter application or form .

## Things I want to know more about

1. I want to learn more about the Virtual DOM in react.

2. Is state OOP?
