# Hello

This topic of this section is important because CSS layout is the webiste design to standout and make clients/visitors to revist the page especially if its a website like Ebay. Know this CSS layout will help me become a better designer and understand the css fundementals.

A layout model designed for one-dimensional content means that excels at taking a bunch of items which have different sizes, and returning the best layout for those items in one format. In CSS the main axis runs across the row and the cross axis runs along the column. The flexbox can cause accessibility a problem by the changing order of items due to logical order.

The advantages of using flexbox over float are the following: vertically centering a block of content inside its parent. Making all the children of a container take up an equal amount of the available width/height, regardless of how much width/height is available. Making all columns in a multiple-column layout adopt the same height even if they contain a different amount of content. This topic will help connect with my long term goals by understand the fundemtals of flexbox and to display web pages items in a awesome design. This will be a great skill because I can display multipy content on a page.

## Things I want to know more about
