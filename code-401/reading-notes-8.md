# 5 steps to RBAC

RBAC is the idea of assigning system access to users based on their role within an organization. The system needs of a given workforce are analyzed, with users grouped into roles based on common job responsibilities and system access needs. Access is then assigned to each person based strictly on their role assignment. With tight adherence to access requirements established for each role, access management becomes much easier. A Role that I will implement using RBAC is a employee role. which includes the access any employee would need, such as email and the intranet site. The approach I will take to implement RBAC is to first identify the roles that are needed for the system. Then I will assign the roles to the users. Then I will assign the permissions to the roles. Then I will assign the permissions to the users.

# wiki - RBAC

Authorization is the process of giving someone permission to do or have something. The tree primary rules for RBAC are Role assignment, Role authorization and Permission authorization. RBAC is like a company. The company has a CEO, managers and employees. The CEO is the admin. The managers are the users. The employees are the permissions. The CEO assigns the managers to the employees. The managers assign the employees to the permissions. It is the chain of command that makes RBAC work.

# RBAC tutorial

The access rights are assicated with the role. The user is assigned a role and the role is assigned access rights. After a user successfully authenticates. The user is then assigned a role and the role is assigned access rights.
The RBAC will benefit a business by allowing the business to assign roles to users. The roles will be assigned access rights. The access rights will be assigned to the users based on the job.

## Reflection

My goals after reading and reviewing the class README are understanding the following:

- Application Flow and Access Control
- Front End (Client Layer)
- Back End (API Layer)
