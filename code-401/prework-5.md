# Data Structures and Algorithms

What is 1 of the more important things you should consider when deciding which data structure is best suited to solve a particular problem?

- The time and space complexity of the data structure especially working with big data.

How can we ensure that weâ€™ll avoid an infinite recursive call stack?

- We can ensure that we will avoid an infinite recursive call stack by making sure that we have a base case that will stop the recursive call.
