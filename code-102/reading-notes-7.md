# Hello

I learn that control flow is a code from one line to another with structure. For example conditionals, loops and functions are a form of control flow. You can ask if the user is 21 or older, if response is 21 or older user can drink. If not older than 21 not old enough to drink. Its a simple perfect example of useing a function that uses conditionals to determine the out put result. I learn a function is a block of code that are parameters. I learn that the parameters are arguments with values so when you invoke the function it displays the vlaue. I learn that a return key will have a result value and code will stop from proccessing.

I learn that functions help reduce the repeating yourself and saves a lot of time. You can use the same functions to make different results. I learn in Javascript you can do math in code like adding, subtracting, dividing in numbers. For strings you can add them as well to combine into one string. I learn that Comparison Operators are less than, equal to, greater than are use in JavaScript to compare values. I learn that Logical operators are use can return true or false when comparing 2 values. The syntax for a function can take a parameters, then block of code with or no return statement.

## Things I want to know more about

For code function toCelsius(fahrenheit){return (5/9) \* (fahrenheit-32);}, for every math equation to be converted into code, How did developers code into JavaScript?

I dont understand the Bitwise operators and want to learn about the left shift, right shift, and unsigned right shift.
