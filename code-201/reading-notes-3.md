# Hello

This topic is important because there are going to be list of items in a website and boxes of information of descripts as well. To have better understing of this will help stlye and write code better.

You should use a unorderlist when you want to make a list of steps in order for example like a steps for cooking a recipe. To change the bullet style on the unorderlist you will use list-style-type property. You should use the unorder list for items like list of hobbies. To change the numbers on orderlist you will need to use the type attribute and and start attribute.

The properties margin and padding play in the role story "The Box Model" is like a security team. Each of them have a range of certain distance they have to maintaion and keep themselves in check with one another. The four parts of an HTML elements box as referred to by the box model are the the margin, padding, border, and content.

The data type store in the arrays can be string, numbers, booleans, arrays, and objects. The people array is a valid array in JavaScript and to access them you use the bracket notation[]. For example people[1][2] will display accountant. The five shorthand opertaors are:

1. Addition assignment (+=) which adds the value together and displays output.

2. Subtraction assignment (+=) which subtracts the value together and displays output.

3. Multiplication assignment (+=) which multiply the value together and displays output.

4. Exponentiation assignment (+=) which adds the value together and displays output.

5. Division assignment (+=) which multiplying different bases raised to the same power and displays output.

The expression will display 10dog. The reason of this result is because false cannot be added since its a boolean then concat together.

A real world example of when a conditional statement is used JavaScript program will be like a online banking to test if the member has enough money to buy an item with the amount they have. A Loop is useful in JavaScript will be a a for loop of an array of peoples name to display one by one at a time.

## Things I want to know more about

1.  When does the Unsigned right shift assignment (>>>=) applied?

2.  Learn about the Relational operators.
