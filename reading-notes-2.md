# Hello

## What I have learn

I have learn that a text editor a software for files to build a website from stratch and free software to use. Each text editor does the same function write code from files and deploy them to build a website. I also learn the IDE (Integrated Development Environment) is similar to text editor but it is not the same. You can do everything from text edit, to debug code, and it is a complier. I learn that there are 2 third party text editor that I did not know was the TextWrangler and BB Edit.
