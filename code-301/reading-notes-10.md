# Hello

This topic matters because understanding how memory storage works and operates will be needed for ecommerce websites for users. For example adding a item to your shopping cart and it saves there even if you closed it you won't need to look foir it again. Here is an example:

![Call Stack](/code-301/Screenshot%202023-05-16%20at%203.14.58%20PM.png)

The call is the function invocation. A call execution one at a time. LIFO means Last In, First Out. The recursive function causes a stack overflow.

- A reference error is a variable that is not yet declared
- A syntax error is something that cannot be parsed in terms of syntax
- A range error is an invalid length
- A type error is trying to use or access data types that are incompatible
- A breakpoint is what happened before that point and try and evaluate the next lines to check if everything is outputting

The word debugger in the code will put a line break.

What is a ‘reference error’?
What is a ‘syntax error’?
What is a ‘range error’?
What is a ‘type error’?
What is a breakpoint?
What does the word ‘debugger’ do in your code?

## Things I want to know more about

1. Do API's have different call stack?
2. Is it better to debug in the browser or IDE?

### Resources I use

Call Stack[^1], error messages and debugging[^note]
