# Hello

This topic of this section is important because as a developer have know to to use CSS for better user experience and enhance your styling skills.

The CSS transform allow the developer to make two-dimensional and three-dimensional elements. A perfect example of this is you have a online shoe store and you are making a three-dimensional of the shoe. The user can see how the shoe looks all around.

The CSS transition allow the developer to alter the appearance and behavior of an element without the use of JavaScript. The CSS animation differ from a CSS transition because it changes the state of the element.

The benefits to using CSS transitions are will excite your users, increase engagement, and client conversions. This will fit in in my career as a front end developer to have better UX experience and when making website for clients or company it will create more users to check out.
