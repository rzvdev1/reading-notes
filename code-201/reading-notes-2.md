# Hello

This topic is important because this is the core to web development and fully understanding the basic fundamental will help in the long run.

Semantic elements are very important due to giving the correct meaning as a global content. There are 6 levels headings in HTML. The use of sub and sup tag are for dates, chemical formulae, and mathematical equations. The difference one is upper level and lower level. The attribute must be added to provide the full expansion of the term is the title.

There are 3 ways to add CSS to the HTML which are external, internal and inline. The external requires a seprate file with extension CSS, internal & inline can be inside the HTML file. You will want to aviod inline style because it will make your code look messy and not readable. Base on the block of code. The h2 is the selector, the components are the values black and 5px, and the properties are the color and padding.

In JavaScript the data type in a single quotes is a String. The four types of Operators are Addition(+), Subtraction, Multiplication, Division(-, \*, /), Strict equality(===), and Not, Does-not-equal(!, !==). A real world function can be if a person has 1000 in checking account to see if they can but an item within the budget amount.

An if statement checks a condition and if it evaluates to true, then the code block will execute. The use of an else if is all conditons need more than outcome. The 3 comparison operators are the following:

1. === and !== — test if one value is identical to, or not identical to, another.
2. < and > — test if one value is less than or greater than another.
3. <= and >= — test if one value is less than or equal to, or greater than or equal to, another.

The key difference in the logical operator And(&&) and Or(||) is that Or operator will return a condition true when though there is a different condtion not equal to it.
