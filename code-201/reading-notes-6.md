# Hello

This topic of this sections is important because JavaScript almost everything is an object and need to be change. These objects are display to the window page for th user to see.

I would say to a friend a object is like a store reciept for the items you brought. The advantage of creating object literals are they are flexiable and easier to maintain. Objects are different from arrays beacuse ogjects can hold any data type and functions. You would need to use bracket notation to access an objectâ€™s property instead of dot notation because you can't use dot notation to access the value, but you can access the value using bracket notation. The this keyword refers to the current object the code is being written inside.

The Document Object Model is the data representation of the objects that comprise the structure and content of a document on the web. The relationship between the DOM and JavaScrip is they both work together for structural representation of each element to display a script.

## Things I want to know more about

1. When JavaScript language was created was it due to objects based program?

2. Is the DOM muniplation reason why web hacking can access restrict company data?
