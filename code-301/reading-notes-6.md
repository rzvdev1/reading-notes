# Hello

This topic matters because as a devloper you will eencounter API's from everywhere and need to know how to work with them.

Roy Fieldindg is a person who helped write the first web servers, that sent documents across the internet. The techniques we use in class wont work because we are only using local machine data. The HTTP protocal that was created was the REST. The Get comes back comes a web page. The Post add something to another system. The Put does a system wants to replace something in another system. The Patch does a partial update.
