# Hello

This topic of this section is important because knowing to degbug and fix is critical to any application. You will need to know how to fix a error and understand why it is causing it. In the real world applications this is critical especially for a banking system.

The Syntax Error are the spelling error you may misspelled a variable when you console log it and a Logic Error is the syntax error like missing a curly braces or parentheses. The type of error I have made was Syntax error I sometimes call a function buts says undefined. I have to check that I was missing a letter or misspelled a variable inside of a fuction I created. I did encounter a logic error on one of the constructions that had a funtion I was missing the parentheses on my function. I also forgot to place the index on a for loop as well and stop a while loop. This topic will help my career by figure out whats not working and errors type. I will become better at fixing bugs and write better code to prevent bugs.

The JavaScript Debugger tool is a build in tool inside the web browser like google chrome. It will like a video slide that moves slow motion to see what is happening and what is not working. A breakpoint is a pause execution and will the codes in console. The call stack is a single thread language which shows you what code was executed to get to the current line.

## Things I want to know more about

1. Is there a logic error documentation book on JavaScript?

2. Are we going to learn how to make a better call stack proficiency?
