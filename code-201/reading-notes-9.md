# Hello

This topic of this section is important because forms are everywhere on a website and JS events to send the data back to server. Know how to utilize this will help understand the client side to server side.

Forms are important to web development because they are used for collecting data from users, or allowing them to control a user interface. The key things to make user experience better design set the right data you want the user to enter and keep it simple. The form elements are form tag which will let the document its a form. The fieldset tag will create a group widget. The label tag will help with form control. The input tag will display what type of content it is. The li tag is also in the form to list items like a checklist.

In JavaScript events are is a reaction that a chain reaction to do something. For example when you click a button it can change colors and alert a message. When using addEventListener() method the 2 arguments you will need are event handler and function. The event object is automatically passed to event handlers to provide extra features and information. This useful because you can add properties and prevent events as well by defualt. The event bubbling are targeting nested elements and event capturing will propagate, starting from the wrapper elements down to the target element that initiated the event cycle.
