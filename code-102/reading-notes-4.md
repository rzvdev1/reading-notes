It does have a be a perfect drawing and stech out perfectly either. You need test the work flow of it so it can become easier for the user to use. Figma is a great tool you see the design, see how the flow is work, and good prototye of your webframe.

I learn the HTML is a markup langauge that uses tags and elements. HTML contains 3 main parts which are the the opening/closing tags, the element, and the content thats going inside the element. HTML uses class amd attributes to style information and other things such are showing a value. HTML has to the the doctype and html elemnt or the page will not display anything you will get a error. I also learn the semantics is a piece of code. For example the the <h1> Hello World! </h1> is a semantic.
