## What is Role Based Access Control (RBAC)?

1. What is Role Based Access Control (RBAC)?

- The role based access control (RBAC) is a security system that controls the access of users to the resources of a system based on the roles of the users. It is a policy neutral access control mechanism defined around roles and privileges. The components of RBAC such as role-permissions, user-role and role-role relationships make it simple to perform user assignments.

2. Share some an example of RBAC including all possible CRUD operations and correlating roles.

- An example of RBAC is the relationship between a companyâ€™s IT department and the rest of the company. The IT department has access to sensitive data and company resources that the rest of the employees do not. The IT department is given this access based on their role as IT professionals. The rest of the employees are not given this access based on their role as non-IT professionals.

3. What are the Benefits of RBAC?

- The benefits of RBAC are increased productivity and security. RBAC ensures that users only have the permissions they need to do their jobs. This reduces the risk of data breaches and other security incidents.
