# Hello

I learn that JavaScript is a compiled programming language. The programming language uses variables, objects, and functions. I learn that asynchronous in JavaScript is udsing effectively handle potential blocking operations such as fetching resources from a server. You can use Javascript from a web browser and mess around it from the console. In the HTML you can link a javascript file by using the script tag or make a seperate file .js put only JavaScript code in one file.

I learn that the alert function is a pop up in the browser and you can type any message inside to display what you want. You can also change a HTML tag by just using JavaScript using document.write function. To see what prints out you use the console.log to display in the terminal. The console.log is a great debugging to to developers. Another way to have a pop up in the browser is the prompt function so that the user can type in the text box. To ask yes or no question you can use the confirm function. This function is cool you can press ok to make true or cancel to make false. This function return a true or false statement.

I learn the basic JavaScript variables and varabiles can be either a number or string. The basic syntax for a varable is a equal(=) sign to define a varaible. To define a varabile you can use var, let, and const. The main difference is const can not reassigned unlike var. Var can be reassigned many times with no error. Also varabiles can be undefined as well which no there is no defintion for it. In JavaScript you can also add numbers using the plus(+) sign. For example var add = 2 + 2 and you can console.log which displays 4.

## Things I want to know more about

1. For a web browser programming language can you interact with other programming languages in the console?

2. I want to learn how JavaScript can speak to your computer besides in the console.
