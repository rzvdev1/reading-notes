#Hello 
The Basic Syntax of Markdown matters becasue in the techonology you can showcase your work, dont need a have a physical server with you, and you can access it from anywhere
I learn what Markdown is and did not know it exsited. I always though that HTML was always need to be there for a wepage to work.
The Syntax is not bad at all and learing the very basic is easy to understand. Not to complex like grasp at first and with overtime you can be proficient.
I do think the blockquotes look cool to say it has better look thank the plain HTML and no CSS.
