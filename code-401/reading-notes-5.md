# Linked Lists

Use an analogy

## What is a Linked List

A data structure that contains nodes that links/points to the next node in the list. A node is a contains data. Linked lists are linear data structures, meaning that there is a sequence and an order to how they are constructed and traversed. it is sructured like a chain. For example a deck of cards are a linked list. Each card is a node that contains data, and the suit and value are the data. The next card is the next node in the list. The last card has a next value of null. Linked list are good to use then you don't know how many items are in a list. Linked lists are also good to use when you want to insert or delete items.

Big O is a way to evaluate the performance of an algorithm and efficiency. The higher this number, the more likely there will be an increase to Running Time and Memory Space. The lower this number, the more likely there will be a decrease to Running Time and Memory Space.
