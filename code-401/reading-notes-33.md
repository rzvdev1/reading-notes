# React Native

## Getting started with react native

Name three Core Components of React Native and describe what they do.

- View displays a container that supports layout with flexbox, style, some touch handling, and accessibility controls
- Text displays text, supports nesting, and touch handling
- Image displays images

What problem does React Native solve (why call it native)?

- react native solves the problem of having to write code for each platform. It allows you to write code once and have it work on both platforms.

What are the building blocks of a React Native app? How does that compare to a React app?

- The building blocks of a react native app are the same as a react app. The difference is that react native uses native components instead of web components.

## Expo

What solution does expo provide?

- Expo provides a set of tools and services that help you build, deploy, and quickly iterate on iOS, Android, and web apps from the same JavaScript/TypeScript codebase.

Expo tries to manage as much of the complexity of building apps as possible, which is why we call it the \_\_\_\_ workflow.

- managed workflow.

What is the difference between React Native and Expo?

- React Native is a framework for building native apps using React. Expo is a set of tools, libraries and services which let you build native iOS and Android apps by writing JavaScript.

## Expo snack

Checkout this tool. What does snack allow you to do?

- Snack allows you to run react native code in the browser and run it on your device.

## Ejecting

What does “eject” mean within the context of Expo?

- Ejecting allows you to use the native build tools for iOS and Android to build and deploy your app to the App Store and Google Play.

When should you not eject?

- If you don't have a mac or don't want to use xcode.

Why might you choose to eject?

- you might choose to eject if you want to use native code or if you want to use a library that requires native code.
