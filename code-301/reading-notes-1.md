# Hello

This topic matters beacuase understanding the fundementals as a developer will help you in the long run and understand why it works.

A component is a modular, portable, replaceable, and reusable set of well-defined functionality that encapsulates its implementation and exporting it as a higher-level interface. The characteristics of a component are the following:

- Reusability − Components are usually designed to be reused in different situations in different applications. However, some components may be designed for a specific task.

- Replaceable − Components may be freely substituted with other similar components.

- Not context specific − Components are designed to operate in different environments and contexts.

- Extensible − A component can be extended from existing components to provide new behavior.

- Encapsulated − A A component depicts the interfaces, which allow the caller to use its functionality, and do not expose details of the internal processes or any internal variables or state.

- Independent − Components are designed to have minimal dependencies on other components.

The advantages of are the following:
Ease of deployment − As new compatible versions become available, it is easier to replace existing versions with no impact on the other components or the system as a whole.

- Reduced cost − The use of third-party components allows you to spread the cost of development and maintenance.

- Ease of development − Components implement well-known interfaces to provide defined functionality, allowing development without impacting other parts of the system.

- Reusable − The use of reusable components means that they can be used to spread the development and maintenance cost across several applications or systems.

- Modification of technical complexity − A component modifies the complexity through the use of a component container and its services.

- Reliability − The overall system reliability increases since the reliability of each individual component enhances the reliability of the whole system via reuse.

- System maintenance and evolution − Easy to change and update the implementation without affecting the rest of the system.

- Independent − Independency and flexible connectivity of components. Independent development of components by different group in parallel. Productivity for the software development and future software development.

Props short for properties and is used in react by passing data from one component to another. The flow of react is uni-directional flow. (one way from parent to child).

## Things I want to know more about

1. Are components only used in the Techonology field?

2. How does react communicate with a server like ubuntu server?

### Resources I use

Component-Based Architecture,[^1] and What is “Props” and how to use it in React?.[^note]
