# Application State with Redux

## Dan Abramov Redux Tutorials

1. What is the first principle of Redux?

- The first principle of Redux is that the entire state of the application will be represented by one JavaScript object.

2. what is a store and what do we use our reducers for within that store?

- A store is a JavaScript object that holds the entire state of the application. We use our reducers to update the state of the application.

3. Name three Redux store methods given to us by createStore and describe their use.

- The three Redux store methods given to us by createStore are getState(), dispatch(action), and subscribe(listener). getState() returns the current state of the application. dispatch(action) is used to update the state of the application. subscribe(listener) is used to add a change listener to the store.

4. Explain to a non-technical recruiter what combineReducers() does and why it is useful.

- A combineReducers is a function that combines multiple reducers into one reducer. For example, its like a folder that contains multiple files. The files are the reducers and the folder is the combineReducers. It is useful because it allows us to use multiple reducers in one application.

## Additional Questions

- I look forward to learning how to use Redux to manage state in a React application. I also look forward to learning more about Graphs and preparing for personal presentation

2. What are your learning goals after reading and reviewing the class README?

- After reading and reviewing the class README, my learning goals are to learn how to use Redux to manage state in a React application, use Redux boilerplate code, and dispatch actions to reducers.
