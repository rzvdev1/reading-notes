# Hello

This topic of this sections is important because knowing how to make manage images, text and color into a perfect user experiance display.

A real world case for the alt attribute being used in a website will be like a buisness graph data for revenue. You can improve accessibility of images in an HTML document by using the alt attribute. A example of when the figure element would be useful in an HTML document is a description of the picture for example beach from oceanside, California. The difference between a gif image and an svg image is a gif is a piture with graphics that move and a svg is a video playing of diagrams. The type of image type would you use to display a screenshot on a webiste is a JPEG because its a compression of still images.

Thw difference between foreground and background colors of an HTML element is one is a text color and one behind the text. For my friend colorless blog website I would use fonts, color, font families, text layouts like text align. For HTML fonts I will use the default fonts so it will be surported to most of the broswe. The font-size change the size text, the font-weight use type of boldness of the text and font-style can be use for italic to display text. You can add spacing around the characters displayed in an h1 element by padding and margin CSS selectors.

## Things I want to know more about

1. For image file type is there a way to encrpt it?

2. For the CSS became a able to grab a html tag is there a binary code generated to recognized?
