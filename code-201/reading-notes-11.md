# Hello

This topic of this section is important because as a developer a a client will have audio, videos, and images to a website and you must be able to build it. Learning the basic syntax to build these elements will improve your still as a front end devloper.

The ability to use video and audio on the web has evolved since the early 2000s becuase we no longer require a Flash and Silverlight any more we use video and audio tags which over the years security and accessibility issues has develop tremendously. In the video element the attributes are src and controls. The src attributes attribute contains a path to the video you want to embed. The controls attribute can have the users the ability to control video and audio playback. It is always important to have a fall back content to a video content because some videos are not supported by the browser and provide a direct link to the video file. Once a upon of time there was a document objects and bob wanted to find out a cool feature the object had. So the document object ask the audio to display music in the background and ask the video so show bob a cool break dance. So together the audio and video help the document object so display a awesome break dance video and bob was entertain how the document object can display it.

A grid layout differ from Flex because it is a two-dimensional layout. A grid container is direct parent of all the grid items which is like the main element that will display the grid. A grid item is children of the grid container which each child will be in whatever location you want it to display. A grid line is a dividing lines that make up the structure of the grid which split each children apart.

Developers will make images responsive because the device the user is a mobile device and wont display correctly. The image has two attributes which are srcset and sizes. The srcset attributes is the set of images we will allow the browser to choose between and what size each image is like the file name and intrinsic width. The sizes attributes is a set of media conditions and indicates what image size would be best to choose like the media condition and width of the slot. The srcset more helpful for responsive images than CSS because it display a resolutions that allows the browser to choose an appropriate resolution image by using srcsetvand easier syntax.
