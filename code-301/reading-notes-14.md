# Hello

This topic matters because this is a big issue in the technology and know about can help solve the issue that arises.

What occurred during the same time as the beginning of the decline of women in computer science was when personal computers started showing up in U.S. homes in significant numbers. This males that had been playing on computers growing up maters because This was a big deal when those kids got to college. As personal computers became more common, computer science professors increasingly assumed that their students had grown up playing with computers at home.

Diversity efforts most successful when they’re driven by a commitment from company leaders. And meaningful commitment requires leaders to understand why diversity matters. The diverse companies perform better because diverse teams are smarter and more creative and different ways of seeing a problem and, thus, faster/better ways of solving it. An example of how a diverse company can serve a diverse user base is when YouTube’s almost entirely right-handed developer team built the iOS app without considering how left-handed people would use it, for example, 5% to 10% of videos were uploaded upside down as a result. This factor may be especially relevant for leaders of consumer tech companies.

## Things I want to know more about

1. For the girls that did own a computer where they still opposed?
2. How exactly are leaders must create a strategy for building a more diverse?
