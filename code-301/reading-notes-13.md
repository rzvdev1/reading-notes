# Hello

This topic matters because understanding the process of CRUD as a full stack developer is a skill need to know. You will be running database for compines and they always add, delete or edit new user/items for their website.

The HTTP method would you use to update a record through an API is PUT Method. The REST methods require for an ID parameter is PUT and DELETE Method.

The relationship between REST and CRUD they both communicate with each other through http commands.

The process of creating a RESTful API in 5 steps:

1. Create a router
2. Connect to database
3. Make a catch error
4. Make request works
5. Update existing data

## Things I want to know more about

1. Is SQL CRUD operations similar?
2. is the other server set similar?
