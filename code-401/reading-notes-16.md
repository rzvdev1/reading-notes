# AWS: Cloud Servers

# AWS EC2

The EC2 Instance is a virtual server in Amazon’s Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) for running applications on the Amazon Web Services (AWS) infrastructure. The 2 use cases for EC2 are web servers and application servers. One main reason to use ECS instead of a service such as Heroku, Digital Ocean, or Render.com is that it is a fully managed service that allows you to deploy and scale your applications. It also allows you to run containers without having to manage servers or clusters. The containers are a lightweight alternative to virtual machines that allow you to run application.

# EC2 For Humans

We can find EC2 on the AWS Console by clicking on the “Services” dropdown menu and selecting “EC2”. The general difference between T2 Micro and XL is that T2 Micro is a general purpose instance that is good for small applications and XL is a memory optimized instance that is good for large applications. The Compute Cycle is the amount of time that a computer spends processing a task. It is measured in seconds. The more compute cycles that a computer has, the faster it can process tasks. For example, how many people can you serve in an hour? If you can serve 10 people in an hour, then you have 10 compute cycles per hour. If you can serve 20 people in an hour, then you have 20 compute cycles per hour. The more compute cycles that you have, the faster you can serve people.

# Elastic Beanstalk

The Elastic Beanstalk is a service that allows you to deploy and manage applications in the AWS cloud.
The relationship between EC2 and Elastic Beanstalk are that EC2 is a service that allows you to deploy and manage applications in the AWS cloud and Elastic Beanstalk is that both of these services are used to deploy and manage applications in the AWS cloud. The benefits of using Elastic Beanstalk are that it is a fully managed service that allows you to deploy and manage applications in the AWS cloud. It also allows you to run containers without having to manage servers or clusters. The containers are a lightweight alternative to virtual machines that allow you to run application. it is a free tool to use and it is easy to use.

# Reflection

My goals after reading and reviewing the class README are understanding the following:

- How to use AWS EC2
- How to use AWS Elastic Beanstalk
- Deploying a server to AWS
- Use the GUI to manage AWS resources
- Use the CLI to manage AWS resources
