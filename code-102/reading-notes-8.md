# Hello

I learn in JavaScript than an assignment operator is the left operand based on the value of its right operand. Instead of rewriting code to add them you can use the += which help reduce repeating the variable. I learn that destructuring assignment syntax is a expression that makes it possible to extract data from arrays or objects. The assignment operator also evaluates from left to right. The comparison operator compares its operands and returns a logical value based on whether the comparison is true. It uses greater than, less than , or equal too. It will can also return false statements as well.

I also learn there are loops which are for loops and while condition. A for loop syntax for ([initialExpression]; [conditionExpression]; [incrementExpression])statement and a while loop syntax is while (condition) statement. The difference is that a while loop and for loop is one a condition is false it will stop looping. A for loop has a variable i and initializes it to 0. It checks that i is less than the number of options in the a element, performs the succeeding if statement, and increments i by 1 after each pass through the loop. So it keeps looping till it reaches its final element. A while loop will always be true and will not stop looping till it becomes false. To void infinite loop make sure there is a false statement.

## Things I want to know more about

1. In JavaScript is destructuring assignment similar to loops?

2. In a while loop the ++ at then end is the same in a for loop to stop the code?

3. In a block of code can a while loop or for loop have a comparison operator inside to find if true or false, which one will be better suited?
