# Hello

This topic of this sections is important because JavaScript OOP is used in real world applications. Learing the fundemantals now will help us prep for the future.

We need domain modeling because its a self-contained objects with the same attributes and behaviors which can validate your understanding of that problem. You should not use tables for page layouts it will reduce accessibility for visually impaired users especially screen readers.The 3 different semantic HTML are the in the table is the following <tr>, <td>, and <table>.A constructor is just a function called using the new keyword and useful becuase you can just update the values for the properties that are different. This keyword refers to the current object the code is being written inside. A prototypes is reuse of an object like for example when I am filling out a check trace form. The form was many boxes that will be the same all I have to to is change the input for every different check but using the same properites by using inheritance from the check trace form is already there.

## Things I want to know more about

1. When using the for/while loops can this keyword be used as well?

2.
